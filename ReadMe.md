# Discord SoundBoard bot

This is a self-hosting bot which can play any mp3 file you put into the sounds folder
## commands

to play a sound simply type [prefix][name of the sound]
so for example if the prefix is 'sb!' and the mp3 file's name is Bruh.mp3 then simply type  
```
sb!Bruh
```
you can list the all the available sounds with:
```
geo!list
```
also you can just play a random sound from the available sounds with:
```
geo!random
```
If you want the bot to stay in the voice channel so you won't hear the annoying joining/leaving sound you can just simply use [prefix]stay [sound name]
```
geo!stay Bruh
```
When you want the bot to leave, use the leave command
```
geo!leave
```
